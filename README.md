# Project_Railway Reservation Management System
1. The objective of this project was to develop a Railway Reservation Management System that allows users to book train tickets, check train schedules, and manage reservations efficiently. The system aimed to solve the manual ticketing issues by providing a digital platform for seamless booking, reducing paperwork, and improving accessibility.  

2. Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL.

3. Designed the user interface using HTML and CSS to make the system responsive and user-friendly. Developed the backend logic using PHP for handling user authentication, train searches, ticket bookings, and cancellations. Created and managed the database in MySQL, ensuring proper table relationships for storing reservations, train details, and user data.  
Implemented basic validation and security measures to ensure correct input handling.  

4. This was a solo project; I worked independently on all aspects of the development. However, I received guidance from my project mentor, who provided insights on improving the project structure and database design.  

5. Successfully developed a working Railway Reservation Management System that could handle basic booking operations.  
Gained practical experience in full-stack development, understanding how frontend and backend communicate.  
Improved my database management skills, learning how to design relational databases and execute SQL queries efficiently.  
Strengthened my problem-solving skills by debugging errors and optimizing the system for better performance.  
While the project was never deployed, it served as a significant learning experience, giving me hands-on exposure to web development, database management, and system design.
